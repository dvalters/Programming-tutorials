    "Welcome to this tutorial about doing data analysis with `pandas`. If you did the Introductory Python tutorial, you'll rememember we briefly looked at the `pandas` package as a way of quickly loading a .csv file to extract some data. This tutorial looks at pandas in some more depth. \n",
    "\n",
    "## What is pandas?\n",
    "\n",
    "Pandas is a package commonly used to deal with data analysis. It simplifies the loading of data from external sources such as text files and databases, as well as providing ways of analysing and manipulating data once it is loaded into your computer. The features provided in pandas automate and simplify a lot of the commonly used tasks that would take many lines of code to write in the basic Python langauge.\n",
    "\n",
    "_If you have used R's dataframes before, or the NumPy package in Python, you may find some similarities in the Python `pandas` package. But if not, don't worry because this tutorial doesn't assume any knowledge of NumPy or R, only basic-level Python._\n",
    "\n",
    "Pandas is a hugely popular, and still growing, Python library used across a range of disciplines from environmental and climate science, through to social science, linguistics, biology, as well as a number of applications in industry such as data analytics, financial trading and many others. If you came to the last tutorial, you'll know I'm a fan of these StackOverflow graphs showing usage of programming languages over time. Well, I found another one showing the growth of Pandas compared to some other Python software libraries:\n",

    "Pandas is best suited for structured, __labled__ data, in other words, tabular data, that has headings or names associated with each column of data. The pandas.org website describes its data-handling strengths as:\n",
    "\n",
    " - Tabular data with heterogeneously-typed columns, as in an SQL table or Excel spreadsheet\n",
    " - Ordered and unordered (not necessarily fixed-frequency) time series data.\n",
    " - Arbitrary matrix data (homogeneously typed or heterogeneous) with row and column labels\n",
    " - Any other form of observational / statistical data sets. The data actually need not be labeled at all to be placed into a pandas data structure\n",
    " \n",
    "Some other important points to note about pandas are:\n",
    "\n",
    " - pandas is __fast__. Python sometimes gets a bad rap for being a bit slow compared to 'compiled' languages such as C and Fortran. But deep down in the internals of Pandas, it is actually written in C, and so processing large datasets is no problem for pandas.\n",
    " - pandas is a dependency of another library called `statsmodels`, making it an important part of the statistical computing ecosystem in Python.\n",
