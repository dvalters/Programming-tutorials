    "# More Parallelism with Cython\n",
    "\n",
    "Before jumping straight into more parallel programming with Cython, let's recap Python's _Global Interpreter Lock_ or GIL for short.\n",
    "\n",
    "The GIL ensures that only one OS-level thread can execute Python bytecde at a time during the execution of a Python programming running with the CPython virtual machine (or 'interpreter', in Python parlance)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key points about the GIL\n",
    "\n",
    "- The GIL affects not just the Python-level code the user writes, but also the Python/C API as a whole.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The GIL is there for a reason - the memory management in CPython is not _thread-safe_ - it was not designed to handle deletion/creation of references to Python objects in a multithreaded world. \n",
    "\n",
    "- As a curious evolution of CPython, some other features in CPython now depend on the fact that the GIL exists, so removing is not a trivial task. \n",
    "\n",
    "- The GIL is specific to CPython. Other implementation of Python such as PyPy, Jython, and Iron-Python have no need for a GIL.\n",
    "\n",
    "- C code that does not work with Python objects can be run without the GIL in effect. This is sometimes referred to as _releasing the GIL_ in interfaces that support it. **Parallel programming in Cython relies on this feature.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Cython code is compiled ahead-of-time, not interpreted, so it is not running Python bytecode. Since we can use Cython to create C-only portions of code that are not tied to a Python object, we can release the global interpreter lock when working with the C-only parts of Cython. So we can use Cython to bypass the GIL and achieve true thread-based parallelism.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cython provides two mechanisms for controlling the GIL: the `nogil` function attribute and the `with nogil:` context manager.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The `nogil` function attribute\n",
    "\n",
    "We can specifiy within Cython code that individual functions can be run with the GIL released. Any such function indicated as `nogil`-safe should be from an external library or declared as `cdef` or `cpdef` - i.e. a C-style function definition in Cython. A `def` function cannot be used with the `nogil` function attribute since these are by definition Python objects. (Funtions are first-class objects in Python).\n",
    "\n",
    "The `nogil` function attribute is declared in the function's signature."

The Cython compiler does a good job of ensuring at compile time that the function will not accept or return Python objects, but it cannot guarantee this 100%, so the programmer should also be careful not to do this themselves.\n",
