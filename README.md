# Programming tutorials and workshops

A repository containing workshops our courses I've delivered or currently working on.

The tutorials in [coding-club-format-tutorials](https://github.com/dvalters/Programming-tutorials/tree/master/coding-club-format-tutorials) are designed for short taster-style workshops organised by [Our Coding Club](https://ourcodingclub.github.io) - A friendly peer-led coding group. They should take no more than 2 hours to deliver and can also be used for self-study outside the workshop.

I usually keep a Jupyter notebook format (for python) as well which is based on the tutorial material - this contains the same material but without the markup and HTML required for rendering on the OurCodingClub website.

## Conference tutorials (90 mins)

**Parallelism with Python**

This tutorial can be used in a 90 minute session and is made up of four short tutorials that introduce a parallel programming module in Python. (Multiprocessing, Numba, Cython and MPI4py)

This was delivered at EuroSciPy 2018 and the Research Software Engineer's conference, 2018.
