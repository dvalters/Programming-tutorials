# Python tutorials and workshops

A repository containing workshops our courses I've delivered or currently working on.

The tutorials in [coding-club-format-tutorials](https://github.com/dvalters/Python-tutorials/tree/master/coding-club-format-tutorials) are designed for short taster-style workshops organised by ourcodingclub.github.io. They should take no more than 2 hours to deliver and can also be used for self-study outside the workshop.

I usually keep a Jupyter notebook format as well which is based on the tutorial material - this contains the same material but without the markup and HTML required for rendering on the OurCodingClub website.
